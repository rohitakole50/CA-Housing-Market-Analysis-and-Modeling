# CA-Housing-Market-Analysis-and-Modeling

## Detailed Description:

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and modeling of the California housing market using various data science and machine learning techniques. The analysis aims to provide insights into the housing market trends and build predictive models to estimate housing prices. The repository includes the following notebooks:

### California Housing Exploratory Data Analysis

This notebook performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the California housing dataset. It includes data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering, and visualizing the data to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset.

### California Housing Data Analysis and Visualization

This notebook extends the EDA by focusing on detailed data visualizations. It leverages various plotting libraries to create informative and interactive visualizations that highlight key aspects of the housing data, such as geographical price distributions, correlations between features, and trend analyses.

### California Housing Sampling and Model Interpretability

This notebook discusses different sampling techniques to handle the dataset effectively. It also delves into model interpretability, explaining the predictions of machine learning models using techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).

### California Housing Decision Tree

This notebook focuses on building and evaluating a decision tree model for predicting housing prices. It includes hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation metrics, and a discussion on the decision tree's interpretability and performance.

### California Housing Hyperparameter Tuning

This notebook covers the process of hyperparameter tuning for various machine learning models. It explores different tuning techniques such as Grid Search and Random Search to optimize model performance, ensuring the best possible predictions.
